* The version that's currently on the server is updating covariate graphs immediately, w/o button click. Is this what we want? I didn't think that's what was supposed to be happening...

* from RG, 13 Jan 2016: on the R tab, include a short paragraph on running it locally (update: this is now on the wiki)

* Make it a package

* Handle missing data: From RG, 16 Feb 2016 email:
If checking allow missing, it does mean imputation for any missing values (effectively nullifying them from the PS model) and automatically creates indicators for all the variables with missingness (as recommended by D'Agostino and Rubin and as better explained by Sarah and Jeffrey). 
Then VP would show the indicator variables as covariates. 
ALSO: before PS calc, need processing to get rid of redundant (collinear) missingness indicators 1st (e.g. sys & dias. bp)

* On Specify tab, make the appearance of the plot-related text and checkbox conditional (i.e. they should appear only after scores have been estimated). Same for the plots?

* Have some sort of smart model adjustment, where if we're down to one value of a variable, that variable is dropped from model? This seems like a good idea, but I think it might have implications I haven't thought through.

* change remaining tags$head's to uiOutput--- I think it's clearer that way

* clean up the naming!

* **Upload new version to server. Remember to change version # and Cairo. Might need to ask Dale to update packages on server. Check the readme and description files too.**

* Consider mirror histograms

* Consider plots of x vs PS as an alternative to histograms. The points could be colored (or use alpha) by in or outside of brush. This wouldn't nec. work for v large datasets (too many points)

* For barplots, put the labels at an angle, or maybe even switch to horizontal/dotplots? I have now angled the labels; need to check w/ dataset w/ long level names

* Add estimated densities to histograms? 

* Consider doing something like the histograms on p. 230 of Li and Greene (matching wts)--- leaving the orig. histogram there as a shell (would mean specifying the breaks in advance) and/or doing the mirroring thing

* Add a tab for scatterplots?

* Think about the example dset included w/ pkg.  
Should it be the same as the one in the documentation? 
That one is slow.
If I'm going to use it, how reference from w/in app?

* Try always making the smaller group the second group, and using a lighter color.  
Then maybe can use higher alpha.  
This is all to avoid the outlining problem.

* Add note "This may take a minute for large dsets"

* Keep testing going back & forth btw tabs

* Incorporate some sort of "rollback" button or a temporary "test PS" button so that graphs aren't totally lost when PS model can't be fit on new sample

* Add option to save a file of all the steps (written every time PS is recalculated).  
This might help with the "rollback" too.

* Add Robert's 'default pruning' idea?

* Later: allow > 2 tx groups

* Maybe show a list of variables for making PS model?

* Move the PS formula example to farther down

* Add to formula help: use ~1 if you don't want to bother/ just want to see covariate distribution

* Find a way to jitter the rug plots for cat. vars, or else do them some other way. 

* Add option to use prognostic score instead?

* Maybe try marking high-leverage points in PS fitting

* Maybe: zoom into histograms/ cut vertical scale off

* Maybe: change # bins (put in binwidth controls)

* Maybe: add KDE & % overlap (Tomarken)

* Maybe: add weighted histograms

* Add standardized diff plot?

    + Calc standardized diffs for selected vars in original sample.
    +   So far: just continuous

    +   Later: squared terms & interactions
    + Calculate unweighted standardized diffs for continuous and binary vars in pruned sample
    + Calculate IPT-weighted standardized diffs for those vars (see Austin, P. C., & Stuart, E. A. (2015).
