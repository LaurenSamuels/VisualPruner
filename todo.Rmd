# Sooner

* Have SMD plots include missingness indicators & squared terms

* 17 Feb 2017: With one particular dataset, Tom is getting an error in the sample size table: Class attributes at column 1 of input list at position 2 does not match...

* This may or may not be related: sometimes people will model s.t. the propensity scores give the probability of being in the larger group (depends on how factor is set up). Can I do something with the factor levels?

* Add button to reset all pruning, and/or provide the original sample limits

* Add error handling for file upload

* Add error handling for while() statements used in naming

* Add blue text as reminder to choose/confirm tx group

* Change how-to-cite info when paper is published.


# Later
* Incorporate the app into a package, with dataset-preparation functions that would add in the missingness indicators and squared terms and interactions so they can be used outside of the app (and in the app, in the SMD plots); in the meantime, could add exportable code for imputation and also for creation of imputation-indicator variables

* Allow > 2 tx groups

* Think about displaying # of missing values in variable-name table. Which dataset would we use as the base though?

* For SMD page: reset checkboxes to FALSE on new dataset upload

* for downloads: keep playing w/ format(s) and what should/does get downloaded when item is null

* Incorporate a plot alternative for v large datasets (too many points).

* For discrete vars, try angling axis labels

* Add note about # of underscores in naPrefix if > 1

* Incorporate some sort of "rollback" button or a temporary "test PS" button so that graphs aren't totally lost when PS model can't be fit on new sample

* Add option to save a file of all the steps (written every time PS is recalculated). This might help with the "rollback" too.

* The missing values are being re-imputed before each recalculation of the propensity score (they change when PSIDs() changes). Think about changing this.

# Maybe
* Maybe: Add option to use prognostic score instead?

* Maybe: put in binwidth controls for histograms

* Maybe: add KDE & % overlap (see Tomarken)

* Add button to select all vars?

* For Compare tab: consider ading K-S test statistics (MS) 

* Consider showing eCDF plots somewhere (RG)

* Show limits for hyperrectangle pruning, and/or add option for hyperrectangle pruning

* For the histograms & bar charts, consider leaving the orig. histogram there as a shell (might mean specifying the breaks in advance). I think this might not be a good idea though because of the zooming you get when you prune. 

* Have PS formula automatically get revised if user prunes a categorical variable (that was originally in the formula) down to one category
