* Make it a package

* Add button to reset all pruning, and/or provide the original sample limits

* For SMD page: reset checkboxes to FALSE on new dataset upload

* Have SMD plots include missingness indicators & squared terms. When incorporating into a package, consider adding functions to add these things to the original dset.

* SMD page: spell out SMD; also add help text about tableone and dotted line

* For example dset: change 'exposed' to something more concrete (compression socks)?

* Show limits for hyperrectangle pruning, and/or add option for hyperrectangle pruning

* Add button to select all vars?

* Think about the top central plots in cases where some people don't have a PS. Should people w/o PS be included in those? I think they currently are but check code. Maybe put a note in. This applies only when useCompleteCasesOnly== 1.

* keep cleaning up the naming!

* Come up w/ a plot alternative for v large datasets (too many points).

* For discrete vars, try angling axis labels

* Add note about # of underscores if > 1

* For the histograms & bar charts, consider leaving the orig. histogram there as a shell (might mean specifying the breaks in advance) 

* Think about the example dset included w/ pkg.  
Should it be the same as the one in the documentation? 
That one is slow.
If I'm going to use it, how reference from w/in app?

* Add note "This may take a minute for large dsets"

* Incorporate some sort of "rollback" button or a temporary "test PS" button so that graphs aren't totally lost when PS model can't be fit on new sample

* Add option to save a file of all the steps (written every time PS is recalculated).  
This might help with the "rollback" too.

* Later: allow > 2 tx groups

* Add to formula help: use ~1 if you don't want to bother/ just want to see covariate distribution

* Put in note: user-specified pruning limits will be moved inwards to nearest sample point 

* Add option to use prognostic score instead?

* Maybe: change # bins (put in binwidth controls)

* Maybe: add KDE & % overlap (Tomarken)

* Maybe: allow choice of PS or logitPS on Prune page
